We could also configure these values at a component level. Take tabsPlacement, we can configure this as a property on our ion-tabs.

<ion-tabs tabsPlacement="top">
  <ion-tab tabTitle="Dash" tabIcon="pulse" [root]="tabRoot"></ion-tab>
</ion-tabs>
The last way we could configure is through URL query strings. This is useful for testing while in the browser. Simply add ?ionic<PROPERTYNAME>=<value> to the url.

http://localhost:8100/?ionicTabsPlacement=bottom
Any value can be added to config, and looked up at a later in any component.

config.set('ios', 'favoriteColor', 'green');

// from any page in your app:
config.get('favoriteColor'); // 'green' when iOS
A config value can come from anywhere and be anything, but there are default values for each mode. The theming documentation has a chart of the default mode configuration. The following chart displays each property with a description of what it controls.
